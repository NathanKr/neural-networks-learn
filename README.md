    <ul>
    <li>the data set is from Andrew Ng machine learning course @ Coursera, 5000 samples , each sample input is 20x20 and output sample is scalar</li>
    <li>ploting the 20x20 images it looks rotated not clear why. i do not know how it will affect learning , i think it will not</li>
    <li>looking at the output vector y is the the following coding : 0 has code 10 all other digit has code same as digit</li>
    <li>it is solved with neural network : layer 1 must have 400 neuron because each sample is 20x20 . using sigmoid activation function last layer must have 10 nurons each representing a digit</li>
    <li>using 10 nurons on last layer we need to update y accordingly to be 5000x10</li>
    </ul>
